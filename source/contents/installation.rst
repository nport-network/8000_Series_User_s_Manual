If any item is found missing or damaged, please contact the local reseller for replacement.

Step 2: Switch Installation
---------------------------
For safe switch installation and operation, it is recommended that you:
	- Visually inspect the power cord to see that it is secured fully to the AC power connector.
	- Make sure that there is proper heat dissipation and adequate ventilation around the switch.
	- Do not place heavy objects on the switch.

Desktop or Shelf Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When installing the switch on a desktop or shelf, the rubber feet included with the device must be attached on the bottom at each corner of the device’s base. Allow enough ventilation space between the device and the objects around it.

Rack Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The switch can be mounted in an EIA standard size 11-inch rack, which can be placed in a wiring closet with other equipment. To install, attach the mounting brackets to the switch’s side panels (one on each side) and secure them with the screws provided (please note that these brackets are not designed for palm size switches).

Please be aware of following safety Instructions when installing:

A) Elevated Operating Ambient - If installed in a closed or multi-unit rack assembly, the operating ambient temperature of the rack environment may be greater than room ambient. Therefore, consideration should be given to installing the equipment in an environment compatible with the maximum ambient temperature (Tma) specified by the manufacturer.
B) Reduced Air Flow - Installation of the equipment in a rack should be such that the amount of air flow required for safe operation of the equipment is not compromised.
C) Mechanical Loading - Mounting of the equipment in the rack should be such that a hazardous condition is not achieved due to uneven mechanical loading.
D) Circuit Overloading - Consideration should be given to the connection of the equipment to the supply circuit and the effect that overloading of the circuits might have on overcurrent protection and supply wiring. Appropriate consideration of equipment nameplate ratings should be used when addressing this concern.
E) Reliable Earthing - Reliable earthing of rack-mounted equipment should be maintained. Particular attention should be given to supply connections other than direct connections to the branch circuit (e.g. use of power strips)."

Step 3: Plugging in the AC Power Cord
--------------------------------------
Users may now connect the AC power cord into the rear of the switch and to an electrical outlet (preferably one that is grounded and surge protected).

Power Failure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As a precaution, the switch should be unplugged in case of power failure. When power is resumed, plug the switch back in.

Grounding the Switch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section describes how to connect the WebSmart Switch to ground. You must complete this procedure before powering your switch.

Required Tools and Equipment

- Ground screws (included in the accessory kit): One M4 x 6 mm (metric) pan-head screw.
- Ground cable (not included in the accessory kit): The grounding cable should be sized according to local and national installation requirements. Depending on the power supply and system, a 12 to 6 AWG copper conductor is required for U.S installation. Commercially available 6 AWG wire is recommended. The length of the cable depends on the proximity of the switch to proper grounding facilities.
- A screwdriver (not included in the accessory kit).

The following steps let you connect the switch to a protective ground:

:Step 1: Verify if the system power is off.

:Step 2: Use the ground cable to place the #8 terminal lug ring on top of the ground-screw opening, as seen in the figure below.

:Step 3: Insert the ground screw into the ground-screw opening.

:Step 4: Using a screwdriver, tighten the ground screw to secure the ground cable to the switch.

:Step 5: Attach the terminal lug ring at the other end of the grounding cable to an appropriate grounding stud or bolt on rack where the switch is installed.

:Step 6: Verify if the connections at the ground connector on the switch and the rack are securely attached.
