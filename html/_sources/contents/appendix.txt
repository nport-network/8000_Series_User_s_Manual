Appendix B – Rack mount
====================================

Instructions
------------

Safety Instructions - Rack Mount Instructions - The following or similar rack-mount instructions are included with the installation instructions:

	A) Elevated Operating Ambient - If installed in a closed or multi-unit rack assembly, the operating ambient temperature of the rack environment may be greater than room ambient. Therefore, consideration should be given to installing the equipment in an environment compatible with the maximum ambient temperature (Tma) specified by the manufacturer.
	B) Reduced Air Flow - Installation of the equipment in a rack should be such that the amount of air flow required for safe operation of the equipment is not compromised.
	C) Mechanical Loading - Mounting of the equipment in the rack should be such that a hazardous condition is not achieved due to uneven mechanical loading.
	D) Circuit Overloading - Consideration should be given to the connection of the equipment to the supply circuit and the effect that overloading of the circuits might have on overcurrent protection and supply wiring. Appropriate consideration of equipment nameplate ratings should be used when addressing this concern.
	E) Reliable Earthing - Reliable earthing of rack-mounted equipment should be maintained. Particular attention should be given to supply connections other than direct connections to the branch circuit (e.g. use of power strips).
