Product Introduction
======================
Thank you and congratulations on your purchase of NPort WebSmart Switch Products. NPort's WebSmart Ethernet switch series blends plug-and-play simplicity with exceptional value and reliability for small and medium-sized business (SMB) networking. All models are housed in a new style rack-mount metal case with easy-to-view front panel diagnostic LEDs.

The brand-new N1-8016/N1-8024/N1-8074 are born to be green by design of IEEE 802.3az Energy Efficient Ethernet compliant (abbreviated as EEE) and NPort Green Technologies. It allows significant power saving during periods of low data activity. In most of use cases and environments, switches are idle in 90% or more of time. While no traffic in a short period of time, ports on these switches get into power saving mode automatically. Once if a packet is received, the switch wakes and works immediately. Connecting to EEE compliant devices, such as PCs and servers, the network can save energy without compromising any performance. While connecting to legacy devices which do not support IEEE 802.3az, NPort Green Technologies can reduce power consumption by detecting short cable and link-down devices.
